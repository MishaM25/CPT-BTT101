<P>This assignment helped me with learning how to organize my thoughts and how to space everything out evenly. I used the canva website which helped me when I needed to choose different pictures and fonts for my writing. This helped me for the future because I will now be able to create a piece of work that stands our and catches attention to customers and if I every want to make a website then I will be able to make it look good because I have practiced and I have learned defferent ways of making it look good.</P>
